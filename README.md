# Name Sorter

This program sorts a list of names by last name and then by given names.

## Building

To compile the program, navigate to the `src` directory and run:

```javac NameSorter.java```

This will create a `NameSorter.class` file in the same directory.

## Usage

To run the program, use the following command:

```name-sorter ./unsorted-names-list.txt```

Replace `./unsorted-names-list.txt` with the path to your textfile, if you wish to use another textfile other than the one I have added.

The program will print the sorted list of names to the console and write the sorted list to a file called `sorted-names-list.txt`.
